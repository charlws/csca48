# CSCA48

All assignments, weekly exercises and extra relevant code for CSCA48 at University of Toronto, Scarborough.

The best part of this repo is [sudoku solver](./week-11/sudoku.c) where I implemented a sudoku solver with optimization based on bit-wise operation. This is out-of-scope for this course but it's the first time I come up with an algorithm with bit-wise operation after retiring from competitive programming (yes, I've learned such method and pre-existing algorithms, but I've never coded anything with it myself lol).

The second best part is [BST](./week-8/bst.c) (actually not just a BST) with autobalancing. This is also out-of-scope but the lecture notes inspired me to add autobalancing and rotation to BST.

The remainder parts are just regular intro to CS stuff with nothing really interesting. Yes, in-scope content for this course is not interesting, at least for me.
