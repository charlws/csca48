 /*
    This function implements the Karplus-Strong plucked string
    algorithm. Karplus-Strong belongs to the class of sound synthesis
    algorithms that attempt to simulate the physical behaviour of
    the sound-producing components of a musical instrument.

    The Karplus-Strong method is in effect a simple simulation of the
    behaviour and propagation of vibrations along a string. It has
    two main components:

    A delay line which represents the vibrating string. The length
    of the delay line must be equivalent to the wavelength at which
    the string vibrates.

    A feedback loop consisting of a low-pass filter. There are many
    ways to set up this filter, here we use the simplest form which
    averages two consecutive samples and feeds them back to the
    input with a gain less than 1.

    The delay line works like this:
    * At each time step, the right-most entry in the delay line is sent
      to the output. The contents of the entire delay line are shifted
      one space to the right, and the input for this time step is
      stored at the left-most space in the delay line.
    * The 'input' in this case comes from the feedback loop.

    A simple schematic of KS is shown below:


			Delay line of length n,
			sound samples move to the
 			right by one space at each
			step
                -------------------------------------
     --- in --->|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |-------------> out
     |          -------------------------------------      |
     |							   |
     |			delay of length 1		   |
   (*.995)  			 _			   |
     |			   /----|_|----\                   |
     |                     |           |                   |
     \-------------------- + ------------------------------/
		Here the new input is
		computed as a weighted sum of
                the current and previous output
		and then multiplied by .995 to
		avoid self-amplifying feedback

   Of course, displacing all data in the delay line would be slow,
   instead. The delay line is implemented as a circular array and two
   pointers are used to keep track of the current input and output.

   Much more complex physical models exist. If you are curious,
   visit the Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in
   Music and Acoustics (CCRMA). And look for 'Virtual Acoustic
   Synthesis' and 'waveguides'.

   Enjoy the sound of plucked strings!

   Incidentally, most software synthesizers rely on recordings of
   instrument waveforms which are played back at the appropriate
   frequency and over which effects and processing are performed.
   Physical simulation is still limited by the complexity and
   computational cost of its models.

   If you are curious about how modern software synthesizers work,
   read up on 'wavetable synthesis'.
